# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Telecom Customer Churn Prediction** is an interactive web application that leverages machine learning to predict customer churn for telecom companies. The app provides both single and batch prediction modes, insightful visualizations, and actionable retention suggestions—all in a modern, animated UI.

## ✨ Features

- **Single & Batch Churn Prediction:**  
  Predict churn for individual customers or upload a CSV for batch processing.
- **Prediction Output:**  
  For each prediction, the app displays the predicted churn probability (%), risk level (Low/Moderate/High), and churn status (Churn/No Churn).
- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Explore customer demographics, service usage, billing etc.
- **Model Explainability:**  
  SHAP-based feature importance for every prediction.
- **Retention Suggestions:**  
  Get actionable, data-driven tips to reduce churn risk.
- **Prediction Logging:**  
  All predictions are logged for review and analysis.
- **Modern UI:**  
  Animated, theme-adaptive interface built with Streamlit.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Input Customer Data:**  
   Enter details manually or upload a CSV file.
2. **Prediction:**  
   The app preprocesses data, applies trained ML models, and predicts churn probability.
3. **Explanation:**  
   SHAP values highlight the top factors influencing each prediction.
4. **Retention Tips:**  
   Get tailored suggestions to reduce churn risk.
5. **Visualization:**  
   Explore customer and churn trends with interactive charts.
